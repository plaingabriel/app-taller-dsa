### Prerequisites

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/plaingabriel/app-taller-dsa.git
    cd app-taller-dsa
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the Database:**

    - Create a folder called `db` in the root of the project

    - Pull the database:
      ```bash
      pnpm drizzle-kit push
      ```
    - The app requires an admin, so you need to create one:

      1. Open the database
         ```bash
         pnpm drizzle-studio
         ```
      2. Open https://local.drizzle.studio
      3. Go to "Users" table and add a new user. Make sure to:
         - The password is a 8 length string
         - The role is admin

4.  **Add environment variable:**

    To use the login feature, you need to set a environment variable that will be the session secret. Here is an example:

    ```env
    SESSION_SECRET=whatever-string-you-want
    ```

    The value can be any string, but the variable must be `SESSION_SECRET`

5.  **Run the app:**

    Run:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
